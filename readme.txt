TabStrips: A TabControl in the Visual Studio 2005 way!

Besides all the new features of Visual Studio, there is a distinct TabControl with a new style like no other. The code here tries to build up a control which behaves like the tab pages of VS.NET 2005.

Building a TabControl consists of building two controls: a TabControl itself, which is a container control, but only accepts TabPages as a containing control. This could be done by assigning a Designer class to the TabControl. Now, TabPage is a container control too, but can accept all kinds of controls hosted in it.

The Visual Studio TabControl slightly differs from a normal tab control, because it only shows as much TabPages as fits the width of the control. All the other TabPages are available via a context menu appearing by clicking the glyph icon. Selecting a TabPage from the menu brings it to position 0 of the TabPageCollection, so that it appears as the first TabPage.
